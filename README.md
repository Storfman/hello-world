# hello-world

My first GitHub repository.

Repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain 
folders and files images videos spreadsheets and data sets.

Branch is a way to work on different versions of a repository at one time. 
We use branches to experiment and to make edits before committing them to master.
